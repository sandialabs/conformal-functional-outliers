# conformal-functional-outliers
This code implements functional outlier detection using the conformal inference framework in the R programming language. This repository is intended to accompany the paper Conformal Anomaly Detection for Functional Data with Elastic Distance Metrics: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01172.

Regarding the data for the simulation experiments described in the manuscript, only the test data sets for experiment 1 are available in this repo due to file size limitations. However, the file R/GenerateExperimentData.R can be used to generate new simulation data. Because of the randomness inherent in the generation process, newly generated data will not exactly match the data used in the experiments. The original data files are available upon request.
